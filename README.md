This repository contains a comprehensive set of tools and scripts designed for both steganography (the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file) and steganalysis (the technique of detecting the presence of hidden information).

The goal of this project is to provide a working demonstration of common data-hiding techniques, primarily focusing on image files, and the corresponding methods used to detect them. It serves as both an educational resource and a foundational toolkit for secure communication and digital forensics.
